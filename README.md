# Rainbow-Simulator
 
## introduction
When I was a kid I always wonder why rainbows exist. Later in high school, a teacher showed me the picture showing light traveling in a droplet with the angle of reflection marked at 40 and 42 degrees. It seems fine at first, but a new question soon arises in my mind. Where are other beams of light that were incident at different angles? To answer my own question, I created this rainbow simulator that takes Fresnel equations into account to create a model that is more like a real rainbow.

## How to use?
Simply run main.py. The sun's angle can be adjusted using the slider on the left side of the screen. Soon after running the simulation, graphs would appear. Moving the slider while the beams are running may result in some buggy behavior.
